//  This program generates two poker hands and tells which one wins.
//  I took a structural approach because it made things much cleaner
//  and more logical to access.

//  Include standard libraries and time for random
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

//  It also has to know how many cards have been dealt so we don't
//  have to iterate through a bunch of blank card objects.
